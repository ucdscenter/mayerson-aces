              <h1>Aces Social Media Study</h1>
              <p>The University of Cincinnati Digital Scholarship Center and the Mayerson Center are studying social media networks and language usage in communities working on alleviating and suffering from Adverse Childhood Experiences. We are hoping to discover solutions to better connecting different actors, while providing professionals with insight into using more accessible language in their messaging. We would like to combine data from twitter and reddit to achieve these goals. All of these data used will be anonymized and only used internally. No tools developed using these data will be for internal use only, with outcomes shared to local professional medical health professionals.
